          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mt-4">Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            Our mission is simple: <strong>to make Pok√©mon type calculations effortless, accurate, and enjoyable.</strong> 
            We want you to spend less time figuring out type matchups and more time enjoying the game.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mt-4">Why We Built TypeCalculator.com</h3>
          <p>
            Pok√©mon battles are as much about knowledge as they are about skill. Type matchups can be tricky, especially 
            with multiple generations of Pok√©mon and changing game mechanics. We built <strong>typecalculator.com</strong> to:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Simplify type effectiveness lookups</li>
            <li>Provide fast and accurate results</li>
            <li>Be accessible on any device</li>
            <li>Support both casual and competitive gameplay</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mt-4">Our Commitment to Accuracy</h3>
          <p>
            We regularly review and update our tool to reflect the latest Pok√©mon data and mechanics. 
            While we strive for accuracy, we also encourage trainers to use this as a helpful guide 
            rather than a replacement for in-game testing and experience.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mt-4">Community & Feedback</h3>
